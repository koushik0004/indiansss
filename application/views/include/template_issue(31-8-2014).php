                	  <p align="justify"><em>Settlement patterns provide not only information on current economic and social aspects of human existence but also a historical record of the past settlement patterns and processes. Naturally, the boundaries of countries and other political entities indicate how people organized the land as they settled it. Thus, it is important to develop an understanding of the fundamental processes, patterns, and functions of human settlement across the earth&rsquo;s surface, and thereby appreciate the spatially ordered ways in which earth has become the home of people. In the present paper, all these have been taken into consideration using the open-source high-resolution images of the different parts of the plains of West Bengal, the corresponding SOI Topographical Maps, ERDAS, the image-processing software and MapInfo, the GIS software.</em></p>

                	  <p align="justify"><em>Having traversed through the Eastern Ghats in a narrow, confined channel till just upstream of Rajahmundry town in Andhra Pradesh, the Godavari becomes a much wider and braided stream here, before splitting into its two main distributaries at the Dowleswaram Barrage, downstream of the town. The numerous channel deposits of the Godavari River consisting mostly of point and mid-channel bars and islands, termed &ldquo;charlands&rdquo;; that occupy and comprise the braided reach of the river from upstream of Rajahmundry to the barrage, have been delineated from different geospatial data products such as LANDSAT, IRS &amp; Google Earth images using image processing software. The plan-form changes in the position of the channel deposits were then ascertained on a temporal scale by mapping their distance and direction of shift via digitization of individual deposits from different images and overlaying of the extracted layers using GIS. Digitization also enabled computation of surface area changes of channel deposits over time. Relative heights of the channel deposits and of the embankment at Rajahmundry were extracted from S.O.I. topographical maps for a short segment of the study reach and a three dimensional surface was created to better visualize and decipher the various micro-terrain attributes existent at that time. Precipitation data for the Rajahmundry area and the Godavari&rsquo;s discharges here have been correlated to understand the river&rsquo;s regime and how it affects the charlands. Incorporation of the river-borne sediment data into the above showcases the river&rsquo;s carrying capacity during varying discharges. A field visit enabled ground-truthing of satellite images, collection of sediment samples from the mid-channel islands for analysis and extraction of surface profiles through clinometric survey. An understanding of the socio-economic condition of the small island communities that dwell on these shifting charlands and whose life and livelihood are most affected by the shifting nature of these channel deposits have been gleaned through questionnaire survey. The land use characteristics of the charland surface mapped from satellite images reveal the prevalent practices.</em></p>

The impetus for this has been provided by the process of globalization, the growing concern for the change in the manner of reciprocity between society and the environment and the ushering in of a technocentric way of spatial analysis. While the map output of prolonged field surveys have always been appreciated and formed the founding stone for cartographic perception, the high resolution satellite images and their processing in a digital environment, the virtual earth and different desktop applications have formed an inseparable part of the present day geography students. Extraction of different thematic layers from toposheets and satellite images for the purpose of comparative analysis have been a favourite topic ever since the LANDSAT series of NASA was launched in the early 1970s. With a constantly improving resolution and its multi-temporal coverage, even the most subtle of the changes can be effectively detected and analyzed. In India, the products available from the IRS series have catered to the National needs along with pioneering works in this field by the agencies of IIRS, Dehradun. The present work focuses on the extraction of different types of data pertaining to Landuse/Landcover from Survey of India Toposheet and different Satellite imagery and their comparison. It also attempts a case study to investigate how the vegetation status can be analyzed and be related to its surroundings.</em></p>

                	  <p align="justify"><em>Koshi flood in Nepal and Bihar district of India is a historical phenomenon. The rage of Koshi has made it a different type of a river that faces upstream erosion, downstream siltation, braiding of channels, political obstacles of two countries and population pressure. In August 2008, the Koshi, a tributary of the mighty Ganges, flooded an area roughly the size of Belgium. The floods changed the course of the river, shifting it 120 km towards a dry river channel it last flowed through a century ago. Millions of people were affected by the devastating flood in both the countries. Though the reason for this recent flood is the breaching of the embankment, it calls for sincere research that may help treating a river more holistically. The embankment of Koshi that are built since the Mughal period has worsened the flood situation by making the river channel higher than its surrounding river basin. The anthropogenic causes are very much responsible to aggravate the flood situation of this river basin with time. This paper is an attempt to pinpoint the devastation of the 2008 flood, its aftermath along with the history of taming the river for so called 'development'.</em></p>

It was in 1985 when the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited took charge and subsequently added another five 210MW units in two stages. The KTPP covers about 900 acres of land out of which 871.89 acres lie in the Panskura-II block and the rest in the Sahid Matangini block, Tamluk.

To date, most researchers have mapped drumlins by tracing contours on maps, or through on-screen digitization directly on top of hillshaded digital elevation models (DEMs). The present study attempts to test object-oriented classification method available through Definiens Developer (V.7) to map drumlins. The Chautauqua drumlin field in Pennsylvania and upstate New York, USA has been chosen as a study area. As it is huge (about 2500 sq. km.), small test areas have been selected for initial testing of the method. The manually digitized polygons were imported into Definiens Developer as thematic vector layer and object-oriented classification was performed. Drumlin parameters were then extracted from polygons and used to compare the manual digitization method with automated object-oriented method. Statistically, there was high agreement between drumlin parameters extracted by the two different methods indicating that Definiens has the ability to extract the appropriate data in a meaningful way</em>.</p>

This contradiction in rainfall distribution modifies the pattern of livelihood and
economic activities of both of these regions. The current study explores the
probability of rainfall occurrence in the four major weather stations of West
Bengal (Darjeeling, Purulia, Berhampore, and Uluberia). By computing the
probability of rainfall occurrence, the return period of a particular amount of
rainfall in a particular station also has been estimated. The prediction for each
station for the occurrence of maximum and minimum rainfall shows the chances
of occurring drought/flood condition at that station characterizing the weather of

regional development, especially between the rural and urban areas.
The current article makes an attempt to analyse the type of regional
disparity and level of development in rural Talasari andDahanutahsils
of Thane district of Maharashtra. It is based on secondary data
published by Govt. as well as non-government agencies. A composite
index of development has been formulated based on various physical,
demographic, social and economic variables and by weighting each of
them with a score of 1 to 5 (i.e. low to very high). The lowest cumulative
score indicates less development and vice versa. The study shows that
the disparity increases from the coastal part to the interior and that
majority of the settlements are functionally and infrastructurally very
poor. As both these tashils are industrially backward, economically
underdeveloped and socially isolated, any developmental effort has to
be specifically focused on the issue of infrastructure.</em></p>

Hydrogeomorphologically, excellent ground water potential has been
found in the fluvial plains. The intensity of erosion in the study area, both in
the structural and residual hills is very high. It exceeds more than 45 m /
hectare/ year. Soils are predominately red sandy, black, alluvial and valley
fill ones. The average annual precipitation of the basin is 720mm. Its
landuse components are net area sown, forest, barren and uncultivable
land, non-agricultural land, permanent pastures, groves, cultural
wasteland and fallow land. Cultivation is mainly done through well and
tank irrigation. The increasing population puts enormous pressure on the
land in the basin. As a result, the landuse pattern of the basin keeps on
changing. The wastelands are being acquired for cultivation, and the
forests are shrinking due to human settlement and developmental
activities. A decrease in rainfall has had its impact on the land; many areas
formerly under cultivation have been transformed into wastelands and
uncultivable lands.

can accelerate or reduce the possibility of flood by controlling the
surface run-off. The district of Murshidabad is located in the deltaic
zone of West Bengal, India. All the spill channels are almost in decaying
stage with reduced water retention capacity. Moreover, due to
increasing population pressure in the district, almost all the run-off
detention basins (or wetlands) have been encroached for cultivation,
thereby affecting the storage capacity to a great extent. Therefore, an
excess of rainfall has a flood-generating potential which often plays a
major role in the occurrence of flood. The present paper aims to bring

implementation of appropriate floodmanagement problems.

which becomes inevitable due to the chocking amenities and
availability of living space in the cities. Expansion of cities in its
peripheral villages results in the forced displacement of lakhs of people

mapped and precisely analyzed with the help of statistical, RS and GIS
techniques. In this study, satellite images (1980, 1990 and 2000) and
GoogleMap(2010) ofBurdwancity and its surroundings (West Bengal,
India) have been used to monitor the nature of the pattern of urban
growth between 1980 and 2010.

                  <p align="justify"><em>India faces challenges in executing the Millennium Development Goals as outlined by
the United Nations on lowering its maternal and child mortality, if not full eradication
and West Bengal deserves special mention as it exhibits satisfactory level of safe
institutional deliveries, but indeed reveals inter-district variations in the proportion of
beneficiaries under maternal health improvement schemes. The findings indicate well
established gaps between the target beneficiaries and those actually brought under
the maternal health schemes. The situation is further complicated by its significant
level of inter-block disparity. All these have been addressed in the present study that
concerns the district of South 24 Parganas containing Sundarban, one of the richest
biodiversity regions of India.

                  <p align="justify"><em>On 25 May 2009 morning severe cyclone Aila hit the Bay of Bengal coast of the Indian Sundarban region with tidal surges up to 6.5 m high, affecting 11 coastal
districts. This damaged and washed away over 1,743 km of embankments, removing
the only protection available to many people along the coast. This tidal surge caused
floods over the entire region which brought high salinity and pH, thereby affecting the
crop production that markedly reduced after this severe cyclone. In the present study
the author tries to explore the effect of a super cyclone like Aila on the rice cropping of
Gosaba.

                  <p align="justify"><em>Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of diseases or infirmity (WHO). The performance of West Bengal has been
noticeable in health care delivery system but still there are more to be done because
the results become often blurred due to the prevalence of the rural-urban disparity in
the achievements of health sector initiatives. The current paper particularly deals with
child population and the various indicators of mortality to substantiate the pattern of its
spatial discrepancy. Nutrition and immunization are regarded as the other major
pillars of healthy life. It also examines the State's achievements in these two fields to
explore the pattern of growth and gap in child health inWest Bengal.
